# Sorting Algorithms Project

This project implements and analyzes the performance of three sorting algorithms: merge sort, quick sort, and insertion sort, in both R and Java.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms and analyze their running times with respect to the size of the input array.

## How to Run
### R Script:
1. Ensure R is installed on your system.
2. Ensure you have ggplot2 and reshape2 libraries installed
2. Execute the `sorting_analysis.R` script using RStudio or any R interpreter.
3. The script will generate graphs representing the running time of each sorting algorithm.

### Java Source Files:
1. Compile the `SortingAlgorithms.java` file using any Java compiler.
2. Run the compiled class file (`SortingAlgorithms.class`) using the Java Virtual Machine.
3. The program will output the running times of merge sort, quick sort, and insertion sort for various input array sizes.

## Dependencies
- R (for running R script)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) (for compiling and running Java source files)
